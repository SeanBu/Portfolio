                <p>Chances are you are at one point in your life you were out of the house and needed to use the
                    restroom
                    but had an incredibly difficult time finding one. If you are in a city like New York it could feel
                    almost impossible to find one. The goal of this application is to solve that and make finding a
                    public
                    restroom as easy as possibly. Using the Google Maps API with data submitted by users results in a
                    convenient to use website and in the future a mobile app.

                    Users can scroll around on google maps to find all the public restrooms near them. If they click on
                    a
                    marker on the map it will bring up information on the restroom like its address, ratings on the
                    restrooms cleanliness and location, a description of the restroom, and an image if available. Users
                    can
                    also add a bathroom themselves via Latitude and Longitude.</p>

                <p>This is a group project where we reversed engineered version of the popular social media site
                    Instagram.
                    Users are able to register for an account using a unique username and a password that is hashed
                    encrypted. Users are able to then login to their account. Once logged in users are able to make a
                    post.
                    Making a post consists of uploading a picture from their computer and adding a caption. Their post
                    will
                    then appear in a global feed which everyone part of the site can view and comment on. In order to
                    make a
                    comment on a post you can click on the image which brings you to a show page of the post which
                    displays
                    the post and any comments the post may have. Users have the option to create a comment on the bottom
                    of
                    the post. Once the comment is made users can edit or delete the comment. Users can also edit the
                    caption
                    on their posts or delete their posts outright.</p>
